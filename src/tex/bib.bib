	abstract = {Three-layer interior models of Uranus and Neptune with central rocky cores, mantles of water, methane, and ammonia (the 'ices'), and outer envelopes primarily composed of hydrogen and helium are presented. The models incorporate a new H2O equation of state based on experimental data which is considerably 'softer' than previous H2O equations of state. Corrections for interior temperatures approximately 5000 K are included in the models, and the thermal evolution of both planets is investigated using recent heat flow measurements. It is found that the evolutionary considerations are consistent with gravitational field data in supporting models with approximately solar abundances of 'ice' and 'rock'. Evolutionary considerations indicate that initial temperatures and luminosities for Uranus and Neptune were not substantially higher than the present value. Both planets apparently have relatively small approximately 1-2 earth masses) hydrogen-helium envelopes, with Neptune's envelope smaller than Uranus'. A monotonic trend is evident among the Jovian planets: all have central rock-ice cores of approximately 15 earth masses, but with hydrogen-helium envelopes which decrease in mass from Jupiter to Saturn to Uranus to Neptune.},

	abstract = {We discuss major challenges in modeling giant impacts between planetary bodies, focusing on the equations of state (EOS). During the giant impact stage of planet formation, rocky planets are melted and partially vaporized. However, most EOS models fail to reproduce experimental constraints on the thermodynamic properties of the major minerals over the required phase space. Here, we present an updated version of the widely-used ANEOS model that includes a user-defined heat capacity limit in the thermal free energy term. Our revised model for forsterite (Mg2SiO4), a common proxy for the mantles of rocky planets, provides a better fit to material data over most of the phase space of giant impacts. We discuss the limitations of this model and the Tillotson equation of state, a commonly used alternative model.},

million variable sources, and the ultimate goal is to have a database of these observations publicly accessible. We describe here a first step, a simple but unprecedented web interface https://asas-sn.osu.edu/ that provides an up to date aperture photometry light curve for any
user-selected sky coordinate. The V band photometry is obtained using a two-pixel (16.″0) radius aperture and is calibrated against the
APASS catalog. Because the light curves are produced in real time, this web tool is relatively slow and can only be used for small samples of objects. However, it also imposes no selection bias on the part of the ASAS-SN team, allowing the user to obtain a light curve for any point on the celestial sphere. We present the tool, describe its capabilities, limitations, and known issues, and provide a few illustrative examples.},

	abstract = {A common origin for the Moon and Earth is required by their identical isotopic composition. However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to that of the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth's mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.},

	abstract = {The Moon is generally believed to have formed from debris ejected by a large off-centre collision with the early Earth. The impact orientation and size are constrained by the angular momentum contained in both the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, a quantity that has been nearly conserved over the past 4.5 billion years. Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth-Moon system has proved difficult. Previous works found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller-and thus more likely-object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

	abstract = {In the giant impact theory, the Moon formed from debris ejected into an Earth-orbiting disk by the collision of a large planet with the early Earth. Prior impact simulations predict that much of the disk material originates from the colliding planet. However, Earth and the Moon have essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions. This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor's composition would have likely differed from that of Earth. We simulated impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet's mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities. Such impacts require subsequent removal of angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system through a resonance with the Sun as recently proposed.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.1461829},
	abstract = {In 1995, the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) adopted a new formulation called “The IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use”, which we abbreviate to IAPWS-95 formulation or IAPWS-95 for short. This IAPWS-95 formulation replaces the previous formulation adopted in 1984. This work provides information on the selected experimental data of the thermodynamic properties of water used to develop the new formulation, but information is also given on newer data. The article presents all details of the IAPWS-95 formulation, which is in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. The function for the residual part of the Helmholtz free energy was fitted to selected data for the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single-phase region (pρT) and of the vapor–liquid phase boundary (pσρ′ρ″T), including the phase-equilibrium condition (Maxwell criterion), and (b) the caloric properties specific isochoric heat capacity, specific isobaric heat capacity, speed of sound, differences in the specific enthalpy and in the specific internal energy, Joule–Thomson coefficient, and isothermal throttling coefficient. By applying modern strategies for optimizing the functional form of the equation of state and for the simultaneous nonlinear fitting to the data of all mentioned properties, the resulting IAPWS-95 formulation covers a validity range for temperatures from the melting line (lowest temperature 251.2 K at 209.9 MPa) to 1273 K and pressures up to 1000 MPa. In this entire range of validity, IAPWS-95 represents even the most accurate data to within their experimental uncertainty. In the most important part of the liquid region, the estimated uncertainty of IAPWS-95 ranges from ±0.001\% to ±0.02\% in density, ±0.03\% to ±0.2\% in speed of sound, and ±0.1\% in isobaric heat capacity. In the liquid region at ambient pressure, IAPWS-95 is extremely accurate in density (uncertainty ⩽±0.0001\%) and in speed of sound (±0.005\%). In a large part of the gas region the estimated uncertainty in density ranges from ±0.03\% to ±0.05\%, in speed of sound it amounts to ±0.15\% and in isobaric heat capacity it is ±0.2\%. In the critical region, IAPWS-95 represents not only the thermal properties very well but also the caloric properties in a reasonable way. Special interest has been focused on the extrapolation behavior of the new formulation. At least for the basic properties such as pressure and enthalpy, IAPWS-95 can be extrapolated up to extremely high pressures and temperatures. In addition to the IAPWS-95 formulation, independent equations for vapor pressure, the densities, and the most important caloric properties along the vapor–liquid phase boundary, and for the pressure on the melting and sublimation curve, are given. Moreover, a so-called gas equation for densities up to 55 kg m−3 is also included.

In the case of Earth-sized planets, the models suggest second-largest bodies of 500 to 3000 km radius, and tens of bodies larger than 100 km radius. Many of these interact with the planet before suffering any fragmentation events with each other. Collision of a large body with Earth could eject iron-deficient crust and upper mantle material, forming a cloud of refractory, volatile-poor dust that could form the Moon. Other satellite systems may have been affected by major capture or collision events of chance character.},

	abstract = {The Earth's Moon is thought to have formed by an impact between the Earth and an impactor around 4.5 billion years ago. This impact could have been so energetic that it could have mixed and homogenized the Earth's mantle. However, this view appears to be inconsistent with geochemical studies that suggest that the Earth's mantle was not mixed by the impact. Another outcome of the impact is that this energetic impact melted the whole mantle, but the extent of mantle melting is not well understood even though it must have had a significant effect on the subsequent evolution of the Earth's interior and atmosphere. To understand the initial state of the Earth's mantle, we perform giant impact simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for three different models: (a) standard: a Mars-sized impactor hits the proto-Earth, (b) fast-spinning Earth: a small impactor hits a rapidly rotating proto-Earth, and (c) sub-Earths: two half Earth-sized planets collide. We use two types of equations of state (MgSiO3 liquid and forsterite) to describe the Earth's mantle. We find that the mantle remains unmixed in (a), but it may be mixed in (b) and (c). The extent of mixing is most extensive in (c). Therefore, (a) is most consistent and (c) may be least consistent with the preservation of the mantle heterogeneity, while (b) may fall between. We determine that the Earth's mantle becomes mostly molten by the impact in all of the models. The choice of the equation of state does not affect these outcomes. Additionally, our results indicate that entropy gains of the mantle materials by a giant impact cannot be predicted well by the Rankine–Hugoniot equations. Moreover, we show that the mantle can remain unmixed on a Moon-forming timescale if it does not become mixed by the impact.},

Under shock pressures between 8.2 and 13.6 GPa, initially 165 K ice is heated to between 673 and 1055 K. In the time frame of the experiment, the shocked H2O releases to the saturation vapor curve and does not achieve full decompression. The temperature results are used to validate the new 5-Phase H2O model equation of state (EOS). The 5-Phase EOS is used to predict the critical shock pressures required to induce melting and vaporization of ice for a wide range of ambient pressures and temperatures. Impact events with velocities as low as 1 km/s will initiate phase changes on icy surfaces. Thus, shock-induced melting and vaporization of ice is a widespread process in the solar system},

We study the internal structure, rotation rate, and atmospheric retention of the post-impact planet, as well as the composition of material ejected into orbit. Most of the material from the impactor's rocky core falls in to the core of the target. However, for higher angular momentum impacts, significant amounts become embedded anisotropically as lumps in the ice layer. Furthermore, most of the impactor's ice and energy is deposited in a hot, high-entropy shell at a radius of {\textasciitilde}3 Earth radii. This could explain Uranus' observed lack of heat flow from the interior and be relevant for understanding its asymmetric magnetic field. We verify the results from the single previous study of lower resolution simulations that an impactor with a mass of at least 2 Earth masses can produce sufficiently rapid rotation in the post-impact Uranus for a range of angular momenta. At least 90\% of the atmosphere remains bound to the final planet after the collision, but over half can be ejected beyond the Roche radius by a 2 or 3 Earth mass impactor. This atmospheric erosion peaks for intermediate impactor angular momenta ({\textasciitilde}3*10{\textasciicircum}36 kg m{\textasciicircum}2 s{\textasciicircum}-1). Rock is more efficiently placed into orbit and made available for satellite formation by 2 Earth mass impactors than 3 Earth mass ones, because it requires tidal disruption that is suppressed by the more massive impactors.},

Their orbital configuration -- measured as the period ratio distribution of adjacent planets in multi-planet systems -- is a strong constraint for formation models. Here we use N-body simulations with synthetic forces from an underlying evolving gaseous disk to model the formation and long-term dynamical evolution of super-Earth systems. While the gas disk is present, planetary embryos grow and migrate inward to form a resonant chain anchored at the inner edge of the disk. These resonant chains are far more compact than the observed super-Earth systems. Once the gas dissipates resonant chains may become dynamically unstable. They undergo a phase of giant impacts that spreads the systems out. Disk turbulence has no measurable effect on the outcome. Our simulations match observations if a small fraction of resonant chains remain stable, while most super-Earths undergo a late dynamical instability. Our statistical analysis restricts the contribution of stable systems to less than \$25{\textbackslash}\%\$. Our results also suggest that the large fraction of observed single planet systems does not necessarily imply any dichotomy in the architecture of planetary systems. Finally, we use the low abundance of resonances in Kepler data to argue that, in reality, the survival of resonant chains happens likely only in \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the cases. This leads to a mystery: in our simulations only 50-60{\textbackslash}\% of resonant chains became unstable whereas at least 75{\textbackslash}\% (and probably 90-95{\textbackslash}\%) must be unstable to match observations.},

For each impactor, a series of collisions were simulated varying the total angular momentum in the system (effectively varying the impact parameter since the velocity at infinity was kept constant). There was a range of angular momenta for each of the cases, except for the 1.0 M⊕ case, in which Uranus was set into rotation with a period less than the present one of 17.24 hr. Most of the runs left ices in orbit, derived from the Uranus atmosphere or the impactor (or both), and a subset of these runs also left some rock or iron from the impactor in orbit. From these simulations we conclude that there is a fairly large range of giant impacts that could have produced the present period and inclination of the spin axis to the plane of the ecliptic, and there is a subset of these that could have deposited suitable material in orbit from which the regular satellites of Uranus could have been assembled. © 1992.},

Furthermore, super-Earths regularly appear in tightly-packed multiple-planet systems, but resonant configurations in such systems are rare. This chapters summarizes current super-Earth formation theories. It starts from the formation of rocky cores and subsequent accretion of gaseous envelopes. We follow the thermal evolution of newly formed super-Earths and discuss their atmospheric mass loss due to disk dispersal, photoevaporation, core-cooling and collisions. We conclude with a comparison of observations and theoretical predictions, highlighting that even super-Earths that appear as barren rocky cores today likely formed with primordial hydrogen and helium envelopes and discuss some paths forward for the future.},

Planet formation is, however, a dynamically active process resulting in collisions between the evolving planetesimals and the production of dust. Thus, indirect observation of planet formation may indeed be possible in the near future. In this paper we present synthetic observations based on numerical N-body simulations of the intermediate phase of planet formation including a state-of-the-art collision model, EDACM, which allows multiple collision outcomes, such as, accretion, erosion, and bouncing events. We show that the formation of planetary embryos may be indirectly observable by a fully functioning ALMA telescope if the surface area involved in planetesimal evolution is sufficiently large and/or the amount of dust produced in the collisions is sufficiently high in mass.},

Higher resolutions appear to determine these large-scale results reliably, but even 108 particles may not be sufficient to study the detailed composition of the debris – finding that almost an order of magnitude more rock is ejected beyond the Roche radius than with 105 particles. We present two software developments that enable this increase in the feasible number of particles. First, we present an algorithm to place any number of particles in a spherical shell such that they all have an SPH density within 1 per cent of the desired value. Particles in model planets built from these nested shells have a root-mean-squared velocity below 1 per cent of the escape speed, which avoids the need for long precursor simulations to produce relaxed initial conditions. Secondly, we develop the hydrodynamics code sph with interdependent fine-grained tasking(swift) for planetary simulations. swift uses task-based parallelism and other modern algorithmic approaches to take full advantage of contemporary supercomputer architectures.

We demonstrate that the details of the equation of state do not play an important role. We show that a head-on collision at 20 km/sec and an off-axis (impact parameter equal to half the radius of proto-Mercury) collision at 35 km/sec are about equivalent as far as damage to proto-Mercury is concerned. Both collisions leave behind a remnant that has the required characteristics of the present Mercury. Whether this scenario is actually successful depends on the size of the condensates in the ejected cloud of debris. Preliminary estimates show that most of the ejected mass is probably removed from Mercury-crossing orbits. If this turns out to be true, a giant collision is a plausible explanation for the strange density of Mercury. © 1988.},

We use our calculated specific entropy of shocked forsterite, and revised entropies for shocked silica, to determine the critical impact velocities for melting or vaporization upon decompression from the shocked state to 1 bar and the triple points, which are near the pressures of the solar nebula. We also demonstrate the importance of the initial temperature on the criteria for vaporization. Applying these results to N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation, we find that up to 20\% to 40\% of the total system mass is processed through collisions with velocities that exceed the criteria for incipient vaporization at the triple point.

	abstract = {Giant impacts dominate the final stages of terrestrial planet formation and set the configuration and compositions of the final system of planets. A giant impact is believed to be responsible for the formation of Earth's Moon, but the specific impact parameters are under debate. Because the canonical Moon-forming impact is the most intensely studied scenario, it is often considered the archetypal giant impact. However, a wide range of impacts with different outcomes are possible. Here we examine the total energy budgets of giant impacts that form Earth-mass bodies and find that they differ substantially across the wide range of possible Moon-forming events. We show that gravitational potential energy exchange is important, and we determine the regime in which potential energy has a significant effect on the collision outcome. Energy is deposited heterogeneously within the colliding planets, increasing their internal energies, and portions of each body attain sufficient entropy for vaporization. After gravitational re-equilibration, post-impact bodies are strongly thermally stratified, with varying amounts of vaporized and supercritical mantle. The canonical Moon-forming impact is a relatively low-energy event and should not be considered the archetype of accretionary giant impacts that form Earth-mass planets. After a giant impact, bodies are significantly inflated in size compared to condensed planets of the same mass, and there are substantial differences in the magnitudes of their potential, kinetic, and internal energy components. As a result, the conditions for metal-silicate equilibration and the subsequent evolution of the planet may vary widely between different impact scenarios.},

	abstract = {Abstract The giant impact hypothesis remains the leading theory for lunar origin. However, current models struggle to explain the Moon's composition and isotopic similarity with Earth. Here we present a new lunar origin model. High‐energy, high‐angular‐momentum giant impacts can create a post‐impact structure that exceeds the corotation limit, which defines the hottest thermal state and angular momentum possible for a corotating body. In a typical super‐corotation‐limit body, traditional definitions of mantle, atmosphere, and disk are not appropriate, and the body forms a new type of planetary structure, named a synestia. Using simulations of cooling synestias combined with dynamic, thermodynamic, and geochemical calculations, we show that satellite formation from a synestia can produce the main features of our Moon. We find that cooling drives mixing of the structure, and condensation generates moonlets that orbit within the synestia, surrounded by tens of bars of bulk silicate Earth vapor. The moonlets and growing moon are heated by the vapor until the first major element (Si) begins to vaporize and buffer the temperature. Moonlets equilibrate with bulk silicate Earth vapor at the temperature of silicate vaporization and the pressure of the structure, establishing the lunar isotopic composition and pattern of moderately volatile elements. Eventually, the cooling synestia recedes within the lunar orbit, terminating the main stage of lunar accretion. Our model shifts the paradigm for lunar origin from specifying a certain impact scenario to achieving a Moon‐forming synestia. Giant impacts that produce potential Moon‐forming synestias were common at the end of terrestrial planet formation.},

	abstract = {©2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. During accretion, terrestrial bodies attain a wide range of thermal and rotational states, which are accompanied by significant changes in physical structure (size, shape, pressure and temperature profile, etc.). However, variations in structure have been neglected in most studies of rocky planet formation and evolution. Here we present a new code, the Highly Eccentric Rotating Concentric U (potential) Layers Equilibrium Structure (HERCULES) code, that solves for the equilibrium structure of planets as a series of overlapping constant-density spheroids. Using HERCULES and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, we show that Earth-like bodies display a dramatic range of morphologies. For any rotating planetary body, there is a thermal limit beyond which the rotational velocity at the equator intersects the Keplerian orbital velocity. Beyond this corotation limit (CoRoL), a hot planetary body forms a structure, which we name a synestia, with a corotating inner region connected to a disk-like outer region. By analyzing calculations of giant impacts and models of planet formation, we show that typical rocky planets are substantially vaporized multiple times during accretion. For the expected angular momentum of growing planets, a large fraction of post-impact bodies will exceed the CoRoL and form synestias. The common occurrence of hot, rotating states during accretion has major implications for planet formation and the properties of the final planets. In particular, the structure of post-impact bodies influences the physical processes that control accretion, core formation, and internal evolution. Synestias also lead to new mechanisms for satellite formation. Finally, the wide variety of possible structures for terrestrial bodies also expands the mass-radius range for rocky exoplanets.},

Pressures subsequently increase because of thermal and rotational evolution of the body. Using the Moon-forming impact as an example, we show that the internal pressures after the collision could have been less than half that in present-day Earth. The current pressure profile was not established until Earth cooled and the Moon receded, a process that may take up to tens of millions of years.

	abstract = {Giant planet migration is an important phenomenon in the evolution of planetary systems. Recent works have shown that giant planet growth and migration can shape the asteroid belt, but these works have not considered interactions between planetesimals. We have calculated the evolution of planetesimal disks, including planetesimal-planetesimal collisions, during gas giant growth and migration. The numbers, locations, and impact velocities of these collisions depend on the specific growth and migration path. We find that giant planet growth alone has little effect on impact velocities, and most of the planetesimals scattered by growing giants do not undergo collisions with each other during the growth period. In contrast, we find that giant planet migration induces large numbers of high velocity collisions between planetesimals. These impacts have sufficient velocities to cause shock-induced vaporization for both water ice and silicate components of planetesimals, and to cause catastrophic disruption of the bodies. New bodies may form from impact debris. Collisional evolution reduces the efficiency of planetesimal implantation into the asteroid belt via giant planet growth and migration. A small fraction of the largest planetesimals implanted into the asteroid belt would have been processed via collisions. We identify important consequences of planetesimal collisions that have not been considered in planet accretion models. The prevalence of high velocity collisions during giant planet migration, and their potential links to the properties of meteorites, and the formation of chondrules, makes impact vaporization a critically important phenomenon. The consequences of vaporizing planetesimal constituents require further detailed study. New collision outcome models for impacts within the nebula, and models for new planetesimal formation are needed.},

The last giant impact marked a major stage in the early history of our planet, with the formation of a highly vaporized protolunar disk, that condenses onto the final Earth and Moon.

In this study, we compute the critical point and liquid spinodal of the bulk silicate Earth composition. We find that the thermal profiles through portions of the protolunar disk and the post-impact Earth exceeded the mantle critical point of 80-130 MPa kbars and 6500-7000 K. We find that Earth, and most rocky planets, will traverse a temporary state that lacks a surface defined by a magma ocean-atmosphere boundary. Furthermore, the atomic structure of the silicate fluid varies with the radius within the disk due to strong pressure and temperature gradients. Fluffy short-lived chemical species dominate the outer parts of the disk, and long-lasting dense polymers abound in the deeper parts. During cooling, the silicate vapor condenses and the composition of the post-impact atmosphere is dominated by species along the mantle vapor curve.},

	abstract = {Giant planets are tens to thousands of times as massive as the Earth and many times as large. Most of their volumes are occupied by hydrogen and helium, the primary constituents of the protostellar disks from which they formed. Significantly, the solar system giants are also highly enriched in heavier elements relative to the Sun, indicating that solid material participated in their assembly. Giant planets account for most of the mass of our planetary system and of those extrasolar planetary systems in which they are present. Therefore, giant planets are primary actors in determining the orbital architectures of planetary systems and, possibly, in affecting the composition of terrestrial planets. This chapter describes the principal route that, according to current knowledge, can lead to the formation of giant planets, the core nucleated accretion model, and an alternative route, the disk instability model, which may lead to the formation of planetary-mass objects on wide orbits.},

	abstract = {Reproducing Uranus and Neptune remains a challenge for simulations of solar system formation. The ice giants’ peculiar obliquities suggest that they both suffered giant collisions during their formation. Thus, there must have been an epoch of accretion dominated by collisions among large planetary embryos in the primordial outer solar system. We test this idea using {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-body numerical simulations including the effects of a gaseous protoplanetary disk. One strong constraint is that the masses of the ice giants are very similar – the Neptune and Uranus mass ratio is {\textasciitilde}1.18. We show that similar-sized ice giants do indeed form by collisions between planetary embryos beyond Saturn. The fraction of successful simulations varies depending on the initial number of planetary embryos in the system, their individual and total masses. Similar-sized ice giants are consistently reproduced in simulations starting with five to ten planetary embryos with initial masses of {\textasciitilde}3–6 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. We conclude that accretion from a population of planetary embryos is a plausible scenario for the origin of Uranus and Neptune.},

	abstract = {Many features of the outer Solar system are replicated in numerical simulations if the giant planets undergo an orbital instability that ejects one or more ice giants. During this instability, Jupiter and Saturn's orbits diverge, crossing their 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR), and this resonance-crossing can excite the terrestrial planet orbits. Using a large ensemble of simulations of this giant-planet instability, we directly model the evolution of the terrestrial planet orbits during this process, paying special attention to systems that reproduce the basic features of the outer planets. In systems that retain four giant planets and finish with Jupiter and Saturn beyond their 2:1 MMR, we find at least an 85 per cent probability that at least one terrestrial planet is lost. Moreover, systems that manage to retain all four terrestrial planets often finish with terrestrial planet eccentricities and inclinations larger than the observed ones. There is less than a ∼5 per cent chance that the terrestrial planet orbits will have a level of excitation comparable to the observed orbits. If we factor in the probability that the outer planetary orbits are well replicated, we find a probability of 1 per cent or less that the orbital architectures of the inner and outer planets are simultaneously reproduced in the same system. These small probabilities raise the prospect that the giant-planet instability occurred before the terrestrial planets had formed. This scenario implies that the giant-planet instability is not the source of the Late Heavy Bombardment and that terrestrial planet formation finished with the giant planets in their modern configuration.},

	abstract = {The chemical equilibrium distribution of 69 elements between gas and melt is modeled for bulk silicate Earth (BSE) material over a wide P – T range (1000–4500 K, 10−6–102 bar). The upper pressure end of this range may occur during lunar formation in the aftermath of a Giant Impact on the proto-Earth. The lower pressures may occur during evaporation from molten silicates on achondritic parent bodies. The virial equation of state shows silicate vapor behaves ideally in the P - T range studied. The BSE melt is modeled as a non-ideal solution and the effects of different activity coefficients and ideal solution are studied. The results presented are 50\% condensation temperatures, major gas species of each element, and the pressure and temperature dependent oxygen fugacity (fO2) of dry and wet BSE material. The dry BSE model has no water because it excludes hydrogen; it also excludes the volatile elements (C, N, F, Cl, Br, I, S, Se, Te). The wet BSE model has water because it includes hydrogen; it also includes the other volatiles. Some key conclusions include the following: (1) much higher condensation temperatures in silicate vapor than in solar composition gas at the same total pressure due to the higher metallicity and higher oxygen fugacity of silicate vapor (cf. Fegley et al. 2020), (2) a different condensation sequence in silicate vapor than in solar composition gas, (3) good agreement between different activity coefficient models except for the alkali elements, which show the largest differences between models, (4) agreement, where overlap exists, with prior published silicate vapor condensation calculations (e.g., Canup et al. 2015, Lock et al. 2018, Wang et al. 2019), (5) condensation of Re, Mo, W, Ru, Os oxides instead of metals over the entire P – T range, (6) a stability field for Ni-rich metal as reported by Lock et al. (2018), (7) agreement between ideal solution (from this work and from Lock et al. 2018) and real solution condensation temperatures for elements with minor deviations from ideality in the oxide melt, (8) similar 50\% condensation temperatures, within a few degrees, in the dry and wet BSE models for the major elements Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Si, and the minor elements Co, Cr, Li, Mn, Ti, V, and (9) much lower 50\% condensation temperatures for elements such as B, Cu, K, Na, Pb, Rb, which form halide, hydroxide, sulfide, selenide, telluride and oxyhalide gases. The latter results are preliminary because the solubilities and activities of volatile elements in silicate melts are not well known, but must be considered for the correct equilibrium distribution, 50\% condensation temperatures and mass balance of halide (F, Cl, Br, I), hydrogen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium bearing species between silicate melt and vapor.},

	abstract = {Mercury’s unusually high mean density has always been attributed to special circumstances that occurred during the formation of the planet or shortly thereafter, and due to the planet’s close proximity to the Sun. The nature of these special circumstances is still being debated and several scenarios, all proposed more than 20 years ago, have been suggested. In all scenarios, the high mean density is the result of severe fractionation occurring between silicates and iron. It is the origin of this fractionation that is at the centre of the debate: is it due to differences in condensation temperature and/or in material characteristics (e.g. density, strength)? Is it because of mantle evaporation due to the close proximity to the Sun? Or is it due to the blasting off of the mantle during a giant impact?},
